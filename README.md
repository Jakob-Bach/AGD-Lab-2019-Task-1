# Task 1(DMC) - Supervisor Repo

## Course-internal test data

### Splits

The splits for the students can be created with the R script `SplitForStudents.R`.
For this purpose, the DMC file `train.csv` has to be placed in a folder `data/` (relative to the script).
No special R packages are required.
